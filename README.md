A web solution for flashcards similar to Anki which uses spaced repetition system (SRS). The website requires a user to log in to manage and review their decks. Decks consist of zero to many cards, and each card has a front and backside. The front side is the question to which the backside holds the answer. When a user flips the card from front to back, a choice between “forgotten” and “remembered” is presented. Depending on the selection, the SRS system will adapt. 

The SRS system balances the frequency of a card’s presence in a review. Cards that have been forgotten will show up more frequently than those that were remembered. A card will be marked as completed and no longer show up in a review when it has been “remembered” enough times in a row.
