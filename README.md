## Decks and cards
Oboe is a tool that can assist in memorization through decks of flashcards. A deck of flashcards can be created for each subject to be memorized. As with physical flashcards, which consist of a front and backside, the same is true for the flashcards in Oboe. The front side contains a hint for the backside, which holds the item to memorize.

## Spaced repetition system
Oboe uses review sessions and spaced repetition to aid in more efficient memorization. Review sessions present the flashcards in a queue where the hardest to remember is placed first in line. Spaced repetition is a technique where the item to memorize is visited multiple times with a period of time in-between each repetition. An item that is hard to remember is visited more frequently in review sessions. Oboe automatically balances its spaced repetition review queue, leaving more time for fun and less time planning a review session.
